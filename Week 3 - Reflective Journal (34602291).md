Week 3 - Reflective Journal
Question: Reflect on strengths and areas for improvement in technical skills 

I believe a strength of mine in terms of technical skills is the knowledge of basic statistical concepts. My prior knowledge from A-Level studies and units learnt at Monash enabled me to have more confidence in my mathematical ability. For example, statisticals concepts such as linear regression which was taught in ADS1001 and learned before university, allowed me to find relationship between the independent (feature) and dependent (target) variables based on data provided. However, a challenge I faced when encountering some of the mathematical units at Monash was not being able to use a calculator during class. Even though there was an urge to, this aided me to be less reliant on the calculator since I could arrive at the same conclusion with the help of the formula sheets. 

Furthermore, an improvement for me is to become a better programmer. To become a better programmer I need to practise creating my own code using what I learn in class. For example, creating code using method chaining. I believe that this beneficial because it is huge aspect of data science. Additionally, researching error messages on Stack Overflow website can help me improve. This is because I can read about similar error messages posted by other data scientists andprogrammers. Therefore, I can utilise that to see if I can identify my mistakes and rectify them.
