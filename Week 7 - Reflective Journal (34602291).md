Reflect on strengths and areas for improvement in soft skills (problem solving, communication, time management).

I believe a strength of mine when combatting data science is problem solving. This is because there are some problems which require unconventional solutions. This soft skill involves trial and error in some situations. For example, in a recent python notebook, one of my answers had an error message. This resulted in me to use quick thinking and to research the meaning behind the message, which led me to the correct answer. I feel that problem-solving is one of the most important aspects of data science because answers may not always be straightforward, which is evident in the example given above. 

An area of improvement in terms of soft skills is communication. This is an extremely vital area especially when working in large groups. I believe that sometimes I am too quiet when in a group setting. Thus, the group project in ADS1002, allows me to take a lead and be more communicative among my peers. A way for me to be more vocal about my ideas could be to actively engage with my group members in order to gain their trust in my ideas. Furthermore, another way for me to be more communicative is to ask more questions in relation to data science, so I can  gain a better understanding of the jobs available in the current market.
