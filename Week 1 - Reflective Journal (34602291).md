Week 1 Reflective Journal: Your group project last semester (Describe the experience.  Analyse your work - did it turn out well? What actions could you take to improve?)

My group project from last semester was using a dataset based on Malaysian Weather. Initially looking at the dataset, we tried to find correlations between the different columns using the correlation command in Python. However, it was clear that the majority of the data set was not correlated. Thus, this led us to think outside the box in terms of what the questions could be in order to paint a clearer picture of the overall data. I felt that the questions were solid as we couldnâ€™t use as much of the data as hoped due to some of it being NaN, thus had to be cleaned. Majority of the questions that we had come up with were comparison questions and specifically looking at differences in climate between land-locked and island states. For example, one of the questions we delved into was whether there was a difference in humidity between Pulau Pinang (island state) versus Kuala Lumpur (land-locked state). To further improve, I wished we had more meetings as a group because assigning individual tasks required more collaboration than expected. I felt as though nearing presentation day we needed more rehearsal as a group to make sure it flows smoothly. Overall, the project was a success in terms of presenting our research to our peers, however, the finer details of the group project needed improvement.
