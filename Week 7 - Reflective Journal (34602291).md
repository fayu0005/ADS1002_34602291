Reflect on strengths and areas for improvement in soft skills (problem solving, communication, time management).

I believe a strength of mine when combatting data science as a whole is problem solving. This is because there some solutions may be an unconventional way to solving the problem at hand. Since this soft skill involves trial and error in some situations, for example, in a recent python notebooks there was an error message. This resulted in me to use quick thinking of researching the meaning behind the message, so I could find the correct answer. I feel that problem-solving is one of the most important aspects of data science because answers may not always be straightforward. 

An area of improvement in terms of soft skills is communication. This is an extremely vital area especially when working in large groups. I believe that sometimes I am too quiet when in a group setting. Thus, the group project in ADS1002, allows me to take a lead and be more communicative among my peers. A way for me to be more vocal about my ideas could be to be to be more open and be more actively engaged with my group members in order to gain their trust in my ideas. Furthermore, another way for me to be more communicative is to ask more questions in relation to data science, so I can  gain a better understanding of the jobs sector.
