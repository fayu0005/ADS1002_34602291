What is your role in the group and has it changed over the semester? If there were any challenges, how did you deal with them?

The current progression of the group project has been going at a good pace. This is due to each group member are achieving their designated tasks. For example, one of my tasks was to combine four columns into one. I did this by creating a list of specific words/symbols to exclude such as ‘.x’ because some of the data given was repetitive. Thus, minimised the amount of data we have to work with. To ensure, that the columns were removed and combined into one, I used the ‘df.head()’. Therefore, allowing me to see all of the columns and the first 5 rows. Furthermore, another task is to briefly outline a few features that are included in the data set, this can be done by using the data dictionary.  

A challenge that I have faced during this time is ensuring that each person has a role and the distribution of roles are balanced. This was a challenge because depending on the task, some may take longer in comparison to others, thus communication was vital. Another challenge that I have faced is that interactions between my group and I are once a week and mainly online meetings. Hence, I think in the coming few weeks leading up to the final presentation we will meet more often to ensure there are no unresolved tasks.
