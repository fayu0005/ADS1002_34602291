Question: What is your role in the group and has it changed over the semester? If there were any challenges, how did you deal with them?

The topic we have chosen was Mortality in ICUs. This topic uses data from a real-life study of 12,000 participants, each with different conditions/diseases. The aim of the study was to see if patients live or die. Therefore, the task is to create a model that predicts whether a patient lives or dies. My role has drastically changed over the semester, since losing a group member. Even though, there is an increase in work load, the group still discusses how to divide the work evenly as possible. 

Initial observations of the data showed that all 37 variables were pre-processed, thus, giving us a starting point. Since there are many variables, each variable has been pre-processed into 3 categories: mean, minimum and maximum. Therefore, each group member has taken on one of these categories. My category is the mean. We also thought that the data might be correlated, thus, we chose categories that may have a correlation with each other, such as age and weight. These small linkages can help us ask a more wider range of questions in order to tell a story of the data. The variables we labelled as important include: age, gender, survival, and weight. These categories will help with predicting the survival rate.
