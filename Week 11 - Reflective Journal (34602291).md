Reflect on strengths and areas for improvement in the following: personal growth (motivation, resilience, adaptability)

I believe that my personal growth improved tremendously since the beginning of the semester. ADS1002 has taught me how to be more resilient in terms of group projects as I feel my group mates are listening and valuing my opinions. This helps me for future projects as I need to trust my gut more and tell my group if I am not happy or something is unclear. Moreover, resilience links nicely with adaptability. This is because I think that I have adapted to my group’s dynamic which had significantly changed from semester 1. Being able to adjust my approach and still contribute meaningfully to the team shows how much I have grown in handling situations that don’t always go as planned.

To further improve, I believe I need to work on my motivation. Sometimes I procrastinate when doing work which hinders my motivation. I realise that procrastination is a normal, however, wasting time is not ideal in certain situations. Thus, to increase my motivation I could set, clear and concise goals in order to manage the work load and not to lose focus. For example, I could use SMART goals which stands for: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Time. This makes it easier for me to complete tasks in a timely fashion.
